// Test script for Doctor Unavailable Feature
// This file demonstrates how to test the bulk reschedule functionality

/**
 * Test Case 1: Doctor becomes unavailable with active appointments
 * 
 * Endpoint: PATCH /api/elastic-scheduling/doctor/1/status
 * Body: { "status": "unavailable" }
 * 
 * Expected Behavior:
 * 1. All active slots for doctor 1 should be deactivated
 * 2. All appointments should be rescheduled to other available doctors
 * 3. Patients should receive notification logs
 * 4. Response should include reschedule count
 */

/**
 * Test Case 2: Direct bulk reschedule
 * 
 * Endpoint: POST /api/elastic-scheduling/doctor/1/bulk-reschedule
 * 
 * Expected Behavior:
 * Same as Test Case 1, but without changing doctor status
 */

/**
 * Test Case 3: No alternative slots available
 * 
 * Setup: Mark all other doctors as unavailable
 * Then: Set target doctor as unavailable
 * 
 * Expected Behavior:
 * 1. Appointments should be cancelled
 * 2. Cancellation notices should be logged
 * 3. Patients should be advised to contact support
 */

/**
 * Test Case 4: Specialization matching
 * 
 * Setup: Have doctors with different specializations
 * Then: Make a specialist doctor unavailable
 * 
 * Expected Behavior:
 * 1. First attempt should find alternative with same specialization
 * 2. If no specialist available, fallback to any available doctor
